### Configurations Managed Over Webconfig

## XFI Making Changes

- XFi user makes changes to SSID/pass config.
- XPC sets SSID/Pass via Webconfig.
- WebConfig pokes RDK (WebPA Poke).
- When configs are applied successfully, XPC receives notifications and sends them to SQS.
- Controller listens to this Notification.
- Controller gather locations devices and issue pokes on pods via  OVSDB.

## Controller Making Changes

- Set configs using WebConfig API to WebConfig.
- Poke GW using Webconfig Poke API (GW poke will always be over WebPA).
- XPC will notify on the application of config.
- Controller already knows locationsâ€™ devices and will issue pokes on pods via ovsdb.
